Scripts
=======

Miscellanous scripts.

- `./chext md *.txt` Convert all .txt files in current directory to .md files
- `color-log.py` For printing simple, color-coded log messages.
- `latex.py` Essential LaTeX bindings for Python. It gets the slashes right.
- `matplotlib-2d.py` Bindings for a few 2-dimensional matplotlib graphs.
- `matplotlib-3d.py` Bindings for 3d contour plots.
- `shell.py` The "right way" (afaik) of making system calls in Python3 via the `subprocess` library.
- `with-cache.rkt` Explicit caching for thunks. Wrap your code in a thunk, then wrap the thunk in a `with-cache` call.
